# GIAC-GWEB-Training
My personal notes and exercises for my GIAC-GWEB certification exam.

**Disclaimer:** Those notes are question-based. However, no questions from the GIAC training material, practice exams or exams are present in this repository. Those questions are my way of taking notes. When I find information that I want to remember, I create a question whose answer is that information. When I review my notes, I make sure that I can answer those questions. Those notes are based on different sources. They are usually referenced in each objective folder.
